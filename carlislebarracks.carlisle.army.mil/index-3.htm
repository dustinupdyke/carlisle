 <p>Carlisle Barracks was home to the Carlisle Indian Industrial School between 1879 and 1918, educating more than 10,000 Native American children during its 39-year operation. Today, the Department of the Army and Carlisle Barracks continues to preserve the history of the school with more than 20 buildings on the National Historic Register, close coordination with the Pennsylvania State Historical Preservation Office and supporting visits and information requests.</p>
 <p>The Army has recently released an archival research report of the Carlisle Indian School Cemetery.  Archival research focused on the cemetery's original location, its removal to its present location, and the inventory of burials in the current location. This report's contents are not intended as a history of the Carlisle Indian School, but rather to provide as complete information as feasible to inform the possible exhumation of remains and their return to tribal descendants. Read the complete report <a href="Archival Research Report - July 2017.pdf" tppabs="http://carlislebarracks.carlisle.army.mil/ciis/docs/Archival Research Report - July 2017.pdf" target="_blank">here</a></p>

<h4><strong>About the Carlisle Indian Industrial School</strong></h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Founded by Army officer Richard Pratt to provide vocational, educational opportunities for Native Americans stemming from his experience in the Frontier Wars. The Army transferred Carlisle Barracks to the Department of the Interior on August 25, 1879 by virtue of General Order No. 52.  The post was transferred to the custody and control of the Interior Department to be used as a school for the education of Indian children.  The Order further stipulated that the post would revert to Army control whenever needed for military purposes</li>
<li>Students recruited directly from western reservations</li>
<li>The school sought to prepare Native American students for life in American society and for skilled jobs in numerous industries.</li>
<li>Once the student mastered English, pre-vocational courses were introduced, as were more advanced academic subjects, including chemistry, physics, government, history, advanced mathematics, and biology. </li>
<li>The daily schedules combined hands-on work experience, academic classes, a study hour, and extracurricular activities. </li>
<li>The majority of the students pursued vocational training that included shoemaking, tinsmithing, carpentry, blacksmithing, wagon-making, and bricklaying.</li>
<li>The first students were enrolled for a minimum of three years. The curriculum requirements changed over the years and the minimum stay later was extended to five years. The full course of study at Carlisle required ten years to complete. The first class graduated in 1889. </li>
<li>Carlisle also offered agricultural training and the school operated three farms.</li>
<li>Under the supervision of craftsmen, students constructed numerous wood frame and masonry buildings on the school campus, many of which are included in the National Historic Landmark District.</li>
<li>Carlisle athletics, led by Jim Thorpe, Charles 'Chief' Bender and Louis Tewanima -- and coaches and trainers, "Pop" Warner, Vance McCormick, and Wallace Denny, were known across the country</li>
<li>Early in the 20th century, annual enrollment at the Indian School reached 1,000 students, representing more than 70 tribes.</li>
<li>Native Americans served in 'the Great War,' but the 1st World War triggered closure of the 39-year-old Carlisle Indian Industrial School. On September 1, 1918, Carlisle Barracks reverted to War Department control.</li>
<li>The U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center has developed a digital collection of photos from the Carlisle Indian Industrial School period. The catalog can be found at <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://cdm16635.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/p16635coll15  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://cdm16635.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/p16635coll15%27" tppabs="http://cdm16635.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/p16635coll15" target="_blank">http://cdm16635.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/p16635coll15</a></li>

    <p>Built sometime before 1887 by Carlisle Indian Industrial School students, Thorpe Gym is one of the three physical fitness facilities on Carlisle Barracks. The building has retained its original purpose as it was also a gym for the Carlisle Indian Industrial School. The facility was enlarged in 1887, adding the three-story front, then renovated in 1976 and again in 2001. It was named after the famed athlete, Jim Thorpe (of Sac and Fox Indian heritage), in 1954 since he won both the Decathlon and Pentathlon in the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden. He is the only athlete to ever win both of these events, though his medals were later taken away and his records stricken from the book because he had played two years of semi-professional baseball which disqualified him from the games as he was not an amateur athlete as the International Olympic Committee required at the time. Also in 1912, he was awarded the, "All Around Amateur Athletic Union Champion of the U.S." His achievements and resulting fame brought recognition and funding to the Carlisle Indian Industrial School. </p>

    <p>Built in 1884, Washington Hall represents the beginning of Carlisle's importance in the 18th century. The building was named after President George Washington, whose presence was required in Carlisle during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794. Washington assembled militia troops from Pennsylvania and New Jersey in Carlisle Square to quell the uprising against a liquor tax in Western Pennsylvania. Washington Hall, though not in existence at the time of this, serves as a reminder of Washington’s importance in American history and his involvement in Carlisle.</p>

<h4><strong>Army enters consultations with Native American tribes</strong></h4>
<p>Nearly 100 years after the Army assumed responsibility for the graves of students from the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, the Army is now in consultation with numerous Native American tribes for disinterment of remains to their families and communities.</p>
<p>The boarding school operated between 1879 and 1918 at Carlisle Barracks, educating more than 10,000 Native American children during its 39-year operation.</p>
<p>The Northern Arapaho, Rosebud Sioux, Standing Rock Sioux Tribes and other interested parties met this week in South Dakota with Army representatives for the first in a series of government-to-government consultations about a path forward. The office of the Army National Military Cemeteries led the Army representation to discuss the process of establishing documentation to establish familial ties or legal authorization prior to disinterment from the cemetery.</p>
<p>The Army also held talks in June in the state of Washington and in October in North Carolina to ensure that other tribes are aware of the possibility and requirements to request disinterment. No remains will be exhumed before then, according to Army spokesperson Dave Foster.</p>
<p>The requirements to exhume a body from a military cemetery include the need for a full statement of reasons for the proposed disinterment, as well as notarized affidavits by all close relatives of the deceased stating that they have no objections. Army cemetery rules define close relatives as spouse, parents, adult brothers and sisters and adult children of the decedent. The military has said that it understands that there will be certain challenges and will work with the tribes on each case.</p>
<p>There are tentative plans to begin the process of disinterment in late July, 2017.   </p>
<!--<p>The Carlisle Barracks Cemetery includes 228 graves: 186 graves of Native Americans who attended the Indian Industrial School, and 42 graves of veterans and/or their eligible dependents. When the Army assumed control of the post in 1918, the cemetery became a military cemetery.  The first burial occurred in February 1882; the cemetery was closed to further interments in 2005. The cemetery is located on the grounds of the 259-year-old military base, near its main entrance on Claremont Road. The graves sites not requested for disinterment will be remain untouched. </p>-->
<p>Today, the Carlisle Barracks Post Cemetery incorporates 229 graves, to include 180 graves of Native Americans who died while attending the Indian Industrial School; and 34 graves of veterans and/or their family members, 14 unknowns and 1 vacant plot.</p>
<p>When the Army assumed control of the post in 1918, the cemetery became a military cemetery.  The cemetery was closed to further interments in 2005 and is operated at the same standards as Arlington National Cemetery.</p>
